in py game a person has to first load an image of object and then display it seperately.
we must insure that quit command is executed wherever necessary .

it is a zobie shooter game with two different mode one with stages and other is mixed , in first mode we have three different level with different zombies ,gun and health and in the mixed mode we have all types of zombies.

we are doing animation by moving the desired object in particular direction with fixed change in cordinate per frame . zombies are spawned using random function.
